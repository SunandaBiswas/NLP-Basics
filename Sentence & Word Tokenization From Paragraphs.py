#### In order to do text preprocessing, for paragraphs firstly it is needed to perform sentence tokenization and after that word tokenization for each words in the sentences. 
#### sent_tokenize() ----> A built in function in NLTK library, this function splits the each sentences into separate lists. 
#### word_tokenize() ----> A built in function in NLTK library, this function splits the sentences by white spaces. The output is the list of words.

paragraph = " Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species, but has come to include all organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1] Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rainforests, plains, grasslands, and other areas, including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities. "

# Tokenizing sentences
sentence_tokenization = nltk.sent_tokenize(paragraph)

# Tokenizing words
words_tokenization = nltk.word_tokenize(paragraph)
